## Question 3

I utilized the handheld 3D surface scanning system, Creaform Go Scan 3D, to capture a three-dimensional facial model. The acquired data was then processed using Blender, a comprehensive 3D editing software. The original facial model is stored in the file `OriginalModel.obj`, while the refined facial model can be found in `ProcessedModel.stl` . For detailed insights and findings, please refer to the experimental report contained within `ExperimentalReport.pdf` .
